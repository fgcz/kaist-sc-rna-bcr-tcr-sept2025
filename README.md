## Working with the project

The simplest way to start your project is right from the Renku
platform - just click on the `Sessions` tab and start a new session.
This will start an interactive environment right in your browser.

To work with the project anywhere outside the Renku platform,
click the `Settings` tab where you will find the
git repo URLs - use `git` to clone the project on whichever machine you want.
